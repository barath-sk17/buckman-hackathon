## Introduction

The investment recommendation system aims to assist users in making informed decisions about their investments. It utilizes demographic information, employment details, and investment behavior to generate personalized recommendations. The system employs machine learning algorithms, including MLPClassifier and XGBClassifier, to predict investment returns and provide actionable insights.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barath-sk17/buckman-hackathon.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd buckman-hackathon
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app_exp.py
```

This command will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application in your web browser.

## File Descriptions

- `app_exp.py`: Main application file containing Streamlit code for the user interface.
- `Sample Data for shortlisting.xlsx`: Sample dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `visualizations/`: Folder to store visualization outputs generated by the application.

## Functionality

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: The `load_data` function loads the dataset from an Excel file using Pandas.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical variables are encoded using LabelEncoder, and features are scaled using StandardScaler.

### Model Training and Evaluation

- **Model Training**: MLPClassifier models are trained for demographic, employment, and investment analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: The accuracy of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Visualization

- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes confusion matrices for demographic, employment, and investment analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Feature Importance**: Displays feature importance plots for Neural Network and XGBoost models.

### Recommendation Generation

- **Generate Recommendation**: Based on user input, the system generates investment recommendations using trained models. Recommendations are determined by combining predictions from Neural Network and XGBoost models.
